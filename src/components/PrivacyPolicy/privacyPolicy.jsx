        These Terms apply to all users, including visitors, registered users,
        and sellers. 2. User Accounts To access certain features of The Canuck
        Mall, including making purchases or listing products, you may need to
        create a user account. When creating an account, you must provide
        accurate and complete information, and you are responsible for

        All products available for purchase through The Canuck Mall are listed
        by third-party vendors. While we strive to ensure that product listings
        are accurate, we cannot guarantee that all descriptions, pricing, or

        include taxes, shipping fees, or other charges, which will be outlined
        during the checkout process. The Canuck Mall reserves the right to
        modify prices at any time without prior notice. 4. Shipping Shipping
        Costs & Delivery Times: Shipping costs, delivery methods, and estimated

        estimated delivery time during checkout. Please note that these are
        estimates and may vary based on external factors. Responsibility for
        Delays: While we work with trusted third-party carriers to ensure timely
        delivery, The Canuck Mall is not responsible for delays caused by these
        carriers or by circumstances beyond our control, such as weather or
        natural disasters. 5. Returns and Refunds Vendor Return Policies: Return
        policies are set by individual sellers and may vary by product. Before
        making a purchase, please review the seller’s return and refund policy,
        which will be clearly stated on the product page. If you wish to return
        an item, you must follow the vendor’s specific return procedures. Refund
        Process: If an item is eligible for a return, the refund process will be
        initiated by the seller. Refunds are typically issued to the original
        payment method once the return is confirmed. 6. Use of the App You agree
